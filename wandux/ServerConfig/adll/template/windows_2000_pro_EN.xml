<comment>This section header identifies that an unattended installation is being performed. This section is required in the Unattend.txt file; otherwise, the answer file is ignored. Parameters that can exist in this section are discussed below.</comment>

<option label="Type of Computer" name="ComputerType" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="custom Hardware Abstraction Layer"> = HAL</choice>
<choice label="OEM"> = OEM</choice>
</option>
<comment>Specifies the type of custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to be loaded by the Setup Loader and installed by text-mode Setup. This parameter is only valid when OemPreinstall = Yes. If this key is not present, Setup attempts to detect the type of computer and install the appropriate retail HAL.

Note 
This parameter is only used if your vendor has supplied a custom HAL.
The HAL description string identifies the HAL to be installed. It must match one of the strings in the [Computer] section of Txtsetup.sif (for a retail HAL), or Txtsetup.oem (for an OEM HAL).
where:
	Retail   informs Setup that the HAL to be installed is part of Windows 2000.
	OEM   indicates that the HAL to be loaded is OEM-supplied. If this is the case, the driver name must also be listed in the [OEMBootFiles] section of the Unattend.txt file.

<option label="Driver Signing Policy" name="DriverSigningPolicy" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="Block"> = Block</choice>
<choice label="Warm" selected="yes"> = Warm</choice>
<choice label="Ignore"> = Ignore</choice>
</option>
<comment>Default: Warn 
Specifies how non-signed drivers are processed during unattended Setup. Signed drivers have gone through the Microsoft driver testing and signing process to ensure they are Windows 2000 compatible.
For the most up-to-date list of supported hardware, see the Hardware Compatibility List by visiting the Microsoft Web site at:
http://www.microsoft.com/
Your Windows 2000 CD includes a copy of this list (drive:\Support\Hcl.txt) that was accurate as of the date Windows 2000 was released.

where:
	Block   Setup does not install the non-signed device driver.
	Warn   Setup stops the installation and prompts the user for input before accepting the non-signed device driver.
	Ignore   Setup continues even if the driver is not signed.

Important
Microsoft strongly advises against using DriverSigningPolicy = Ignore unless you have fully tested the device driver in your environment and are sure that it works properly. Using non-signed drivers increases the risk of device driver problems that can effect the performance or stability of your computer. 
If you are using DriverSigningPolicy = Ignore and you attempt to install a newer, unsigned copy of a driver that is protected by Windows 2000, the policy level is automatically updated to Warn.
</comment>
<comment>The ExtendOemPartition key is used to extend the partition on which you are installing Windows 2000. This key causes Setup to extend this destination partition into any available unpartitioned space that physically follows it on the disk.
where:
	0	Setup does not extend the partition
	1	Setup extends the partition to fill out the hard disk
	extra size in MB	Setup increases the current partition size by this amount.

Important 

	Only NTFS partitions can be extended. If the destination partition you plan to extend is FAT or FAT32, set FileSystem = ConvertNTFS to convert the partition during text-mode Setup.
	This key can be used with both the Unattend.txt and Sysprep.inf Setup files. 
	When used in Sysprep.inf for imaged computers, the destination computer s hard disk must be the same size or larger than the master computer s hard disk.

</comment>
<option label="File System setup" name="FileSystem" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="Convert to NTFS"> = ConvertNTFS</choice>
<choice label="Leave Alone"> = LeaveAlone</choice>
</option>
<comment>Specifies whether the primary partition should be converted to NTFS or left alone.

Note 
If you plan to use ExtendOemPartition during Setup, set FileSystem = ConvertNTFS. For more information, see ‚ÄúExtendOemPartition,‚Äù earlier in this document.

</comment>
<option label="Keyboard Layout" name="KeyboardLayout = " type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice>
</option>
<comment>Specifies the type of keyboard layout to be installed during text-mode Setup. If this key does not exist, Setup detects and installs a keyboard layout.
This key must match one of the right-hand strings (in quotes) in the [Keyboard Layout] section of Txtsetup.sif.

<option label="Is this an Nt Upgrade" name="NtUpgrade" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="Yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="No"> = no</choice>
</option>
<comment>Determines whether a previous version of Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server, or Windows 2000 Datacenter Server should be upgraded. This parameter is only valid for Winnt32.exe.
Set NTUpgrade = Yes to upgrade the previous Windows NT or Windows 2000 installation. If OemPreinstall = Yes, NTUpgrade should not be set to Yes.

Note 

	This key upgrades your previous version of Windows 2000, Windows NT 3.51, or Windows NT 4.0. All user settings are taken from the previous installation, so no user intervention is required during Setup.
	To upgrade from Windows 95 or Windows 98, use the Win9xUpgrade key.
</comment>

<option label="Path of OEM Files" name="OemFilesPath = " type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice>
</option>
<comment>Specifies the path to the \$OEM$ folder (containing OEM files) if it does not exist under the i386 folder of the distribution share point. The path can be a UNC name.
For more information about the \$OEM$ folder, see the Microsoft Windows 2000 OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) User Guide if you are a computer manufacturer. Otherwise, see the Microsoft Windows 2000 Deployment Guide.
</comment>
<option label="Oem PnP Drivers Path" name="OemPnPDriversPath = " type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice>
 </option>
<comment>Specifies the path to folders that contain Plug and Play (PnP) drivers that do not ship on the Windows 2000 CD. The folders must contain all the files necessary to install the particular devices‚Äîcatalog files, .inf files, and drivers.
For example, if you have a folder called \Drivers with subfolders called \Audio and \Net, you would specify OemPnPDriversPath = ‚Äúdrivers\audio;drivers\net‚Äù in the answer file. Setup adds:
	%systemdrive% to each of the folder names 
	the path for each subfolder to the PnP device search path.

Note
When using this parameter, be sure that the folders are available during GUI-mode Setup or Mini-Setup‚Äîyou can use the \$OEM$\$1 directory structure mechanism for this. For best results, make sure your drivers are signed.

</comment>
<option label="Oem Preinstall" name="OemPreinstall" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = no</choice>
</option>
<comment>Determines whether an installation from distribution folders is being performed. When value is Yes, any other existing subfolders are copied. No means a regular unattended installation is being performed.</comment>
<option label="Skip the Microsoft License Agreement" name="OemSkipEula" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes" selected="yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = no</choice>
</option>
<comment>Determines whether the user should be prompted to accept the Microsoft License Agreement (previously known as the End User License Agreement or EULA) included with Windows 2000. Writing this key and setting it to Yes implies that the person performing the installation has read and agreed to the contents of the License Agreement included with the product. It also implies that the end-user on whose behalf Windows 2000 is being installed has agreed to the License Agreement.

Important
OEMs must not use this key to bypass the Microsoft License Agreement screen because end users are required to see and accept it.
</comment>
<option label="Overwrite Oem Files On Upgrade" name="OverwriteOemFilesOnUpgrade" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = no</choice></option>
<comment>Determines whether OEM-supplied files that have the same name as Windows 2000 system files should be overwritten during an unattended upgrade.
Yes means overwrite the files. No means do not overwrite the files if found. The default behavior is to overwrite OEM-supplied files.

Note 
This key is provided for backward compatibility only and will be removed from future versions.
</comment>
<option label="Repartition ?" name="Repartition" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="Yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="No"> = no</choice></option>
<comment>Specifies whether or not all partitions on the first drive on the client computer should be deleted and the drive reformatted with the NTFS file system.

Important
Repartition is only valid when performing an unattended installation by booting the computer from the Windows 2000 CD.
</comment>
<option label="Target Path" name="TargetPath = " type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="">*</choice>
</option>
<comment>Determines the installation folder in which Windows 2000 should be installed.
* indicates that Setup should generate a unique folder name for the installation. The folder name given is usually Winnt, unless that folder already exists. In that case, Setup installs into Winnt.x (where x is 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ 999) if that folder does not already exist.
path name is the user-defined installation folder and should not include the drive letter. If you want to specify the target drive, you must use the /tempdrive parameter with Winnt32.exe or the /t switch with Winnt.exe.
</comment>
<option label="Unattend Mode" name="UnattendMode" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="Gui Attended"> = GuiAttended</choice>
<choice label="Provide Default"> = ProvideDefault</choice>
<choice label="Default Hide"> = DefaultHide</choice>
<choice label="Read Only"> = ReadOnly</choice>
<choice label="Fully unattended Installation" selected="yes"> = FullUnattended</choice>
</option>
<comment>where:
	GuiAttended   specifies that the GUI-mode section of Setup is attended. When specified, the end-user is required to answer all questions in the GUI-mode portion of Setup before Setup finishes. This mode is useful in preinstallation scenarios in which the OEM or administrator wants to automate only text-mode Setup.
	ProvideDefault   specifies that answers in the answer file are defaults. In this case, Setup displays these default answers to the user, who may change them if desired. This approach is useful in preinstallation scenarios where the OEM or administrator wants to give the person setting up the computer the option to change the predefined default answers (especially network options).
	DefaultHide   specifies that answers in the answer file are defaults. Unlike the ProvideDefault value, Setup does not display the user interface to end-users if all the answers relating to a particular wizard page are specified in the answer file. If only subsets of the answers on a page are specified, the page is displayed with the provided answers. The user can modify any of the answers on the displayed page. This approach is useful in deployment scenarios where an administrator may only want end-users to provide the administrator password on the computer. This behavior is the default if unattended Setup mode is not specified.

	ReadOnly   specifies that answers in the answer file are read-only if the wizard pages containing these answers are displayed to the end-user. Just like the DefaultHide parameter, no user interface appears if all answers on a page are supplied in the answer file. Unlike the DefaultHide parameter, however, the user can only specify new answers on a displayed page. This approach is useful in scenarios where an administrator wants to force specific answers on a page but not others.
	FullUnattended   specifies that GUI-mode Setup is fully unattended. If a required Setup answer is not specified in the answer file, an error is generated. This behavior is useful in deployment scenarios where a complete hands-off installation is required and an unspecified answer is an error in the answer file.
</comment>
<option label="Win9x Upgrade ?" name="Win9xUpgrade" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = no</choice></option>
<comment>Determines whether previous installations of Windows 95 or Windows 98 should be upgraded to Windows 2000.
Yes means that the Windows installation should be upgraded, and No means that the Windows installation, if found, should not be upgraded. The default is No. This parameter is only necessary when using an answer file to upgrade an existing Windows 95 or Windows 98 computer to Windows 2000. This parameter is only valid for Winnt32.exe.

<section label="Win9x Upgrade" name="[Win9xUpg]">
<comment>This section specifies the parameters for an unattended upgrade from Windows 95 or Windows 98. These parameters are not valid on any other upgrade path.
</comment>
<option label="Default Password" name="DefaultPassword = "  type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice></option>
<comment>Provides a default password for all local accounts created during a migration process. Since Setup cannot migrate the Windows passwords of users when upgrading a system, it must assign passwords for those created accounts. When Setup needs to assign one of these passwords, it first checks to see if a UserPassword (see "UserPassword," earlier in this document) entry for that user exists. If not, it uses the value of this key if specified.</comment>
<option label="Force Password Change" name="ForcePasswordChange" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Informs Setup to automatically require a password change on all local accounts it creates during the migration process. When a user first logs on using one of these accounts, the user is informed that the current password has expired. The user is forced to select a new password before logging on.</comment>
<option label="Migrate Default User" name="MigrateDefaultUser" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Causes Setup to migrate the default Windows 95 or Windows 98 user account settings to the default Windows 2000 user account.</comment>
<option label="Migrate Users As Admin" name="MigrateUsersAsAdmin" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Causes Setup to add all accounts that it creates during migration to the Local Administrators group, giving those users full control over the computer. If users are not migrated as administrators, some migrated applications and settings may not work properly after the upgrade is completed.</comment>
<option label="Migrate Users As PowerUser" name="MigrateUsersAsPowerUser" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Causes Setup to add all accounts that it creates during migration to the Power Users group, giving Power Users more permissions than users in the Users group, but fewer permissions than users in the Administrators group. Power Users can perform any operating system task except tasks reserved for the Administrators group.</comment>
<option label="Migration Dlls" name="MigrationDlls = "  type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice></option>
<comment>Specifies the location of upgrade packs that Setup needs to copy and process during an upgrade to Windows 2000. If multiple paths are specified, commas must separate the paths. Setup searches each of these paths (including its subfolders) for upgrade packs. Multiple upgrade packs can be located at a single location, but each upgrade pack must exist in its own subfolder of that single path. Do not put more than one upgrade pack in a single folder.</comment>
<option label="Report Only" name="ReportOnly" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Instructs Setup to generate an upgrade report and then exit without making any changes to the current Windows 95 or Windows 98 installation. The upgrade report contains a list of hardware and software incompatibilities and is saved to the root of the system drive if the SaveReportTo key is not specified.</comment>
<option label="Save Report To" name="SaveReportTo = "  type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice></option>
<comment>Specifies the full path and file name of the upgrade report (text file) generated by Setup. If the Windows 95 or Windows 98 installation has network connectivity, the path to report can be a UNC path.</comment>
<option label="Use Local Account On Error" name="UseLocalAccountOnError" type="radio" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label="yes"> = Yes</choice>
<choice label="no"> = No</choice></option>
<comment>Directs Setup to create a local account if a network account cannot be automatically determined or resolved.</comment>
<option label="User Domain" name="UserDomain = "  type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice></option>
<comment>Specifies the user domain for a user. Multiple UserDomain lines can be used to specify different domains for different users. When specified, this key prevents Setup from searching all trusted domains on the network for a matching user account. (The search process can be time-consuming if a large number of trusted domains exist on the network.)</comment>
<option label="User Password" name="UserPassword = "  type="text" terminator="&#xD;&#xA;">
<choice label=""></choice></option>
<comment>Provides Setup with the names of the passwords to create for specific local accounts. Because Setup cannot migrate the Windows passwords of users when upgrading a system, it must create passwords for non-domain accounts during the migration process. Using this key, an administrator can predetermine what those passwords are for specific users.</comment>
